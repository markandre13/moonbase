Please note:

- run 'build' to build MoonBase
- You SOULDN'T use MoonBase only when working with huge databases because
  MoonBase is slow and doesn't know all theses nice features a good SQL
  database has.
- MoonBase will do fine with small databases, maybe up to 100 records or as
  a just-for-fun database.
- MoonBase will help you to import xBase databases when moving to a real
  DBMS.
- Since i haven't installed Tcl/Tk anymore i don't know if dbwish still
  compiles. One shouldn't use this nasty interpreter anyhow.
